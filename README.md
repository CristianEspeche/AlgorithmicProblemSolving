# AlgorithmicProblemSolving
Algorithmic problem-solving is the process of designing and implementing a solution to a problem using a series of steps or rules. These steps are often referred to as an algorithm. The goal of algorithmic problem-solving is to find an efficient and effective solution to a given problem.

Sure! Here are the translated exercises for all categories:

---

### **1 - Data Structures (Trees, Graphs, Linked Lists)**  
- **Trees:** Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to find the longest path from the root to a leaf.  
- **Graphs:** Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted directed graph.  
- **Linked Lists:** Write a function to detect a cycle in a linked list, and if one exists, determine the starting node of the cycle.

### **2 - Algorithm Optimization (Big-O Notation)**  
- Optimize a search algorithm in an unsorted list of size `n`, comparing different approaches (linear search vs. data structures that allow fast lookup, such as hash tables or BST).  
- Given an array of integers, find the `k` most frequent elements efficiently (try to achieve better than `O(n log n)`).  
- Implement an algorithm to find the intersection of two arrays in `O(n)` time.

### **3 - Distributed Systems (Caching, Concurrency)**  
- Design an algorithm for an **LRU Cache** (Least Recently Used).  
- Implement a **distributed task queue** using multiple threads/processes in Java.  
- Simulate concurrency in a banking system where multiple threads can make deposits and withdrawals on the same account.

### **4 - Advanced SQL (Joins, Indexes, Query Optimization)**  
- Given a database with tables `Users (id, name)`, `Orders (id, user_id, total)`, and `Products (id, name, price)`, write a query to retrieve users who have spent more than $1000 on specific products.  
- Explain how to improve query performance using indexes and when an index can be detrimental.  
- Given a table with millions of records, how would you optimize a `SELECT DISTINCT` query on a column?
